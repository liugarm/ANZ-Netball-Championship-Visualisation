# ANZ-Netball-Championship-Visualisation

A project where data of the ANZ Netball Championships 2008-2013 were stored in CSV files, and were required to be imported using
a Javascript library called Data-Driven Documents (D3) to create a visualisation so that users could easily understand it. 

I decided to visualise it in a way where the user is able to select the year which would then display multiple circles, each circle 
representing one match. The user can then select a circle and view the match details (such as who won etc). The user is also able 
to filter the matches so that only those that meet the filter requirements will display, making it much easier to search for specific
matches.
